# MOVIE DATASET EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION PROJECT
## Introduction
In this project, we explore a comprehensive movie dataset sourced from Kaggle to analyze and visualize various trends within the film industry. Movies are a significant part of global culture, and understanding industry patterns provides valuable insights into audience preferences, genre popularity, director success, and the evolution of these elements over time.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

* Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to explore key aspects, such as movie genres, ratings, director popularity, and trends related to release years.
* Data Visualization: Develop interactive dashboards that display these insights in a visually engaging way, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset sourced from TMDB includes the following columns:

* budget
* genres
* homepage
* id
* keywords
* original_language
* original_title
* overview
* popularity
* production_companies
* production_countries
* release_date
* revenue
* runtime
* spoken_languages
* status
* tagline
* title
* vote_average
* vote_count
By the end of this project, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the movie industry dynamics and create a tool that offers personalized movie recommendations. Let's dive into the data to uncover the stories it holds.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and imported into a Colab notebook for analysis. The first step involved removing unnecessary columns that were not relevant for the current visualization process. Next, duplicated rows were eliminated, data types were ascertained, and any missing values were corrected.

Several columns contained data in JSON format, so custom functions were created to extract the most relevant information, improving the dataset's efficiency.

## Data Exploration
This phase involved testing the accuracy of the data and identifying potential issues. We used basic line and bar charts to visualize some of the columns, showcasing the fundamentals of data visualization with Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Additionally, a correlation heatmap was generated to illustrate the relationships between various numerical variables, offering insights that would prove useful in later stages of visualization.

## Data Visualization Dashboard
For the visualization, Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards. The cleaned dataset from the Colab notebook was imported into Tableau for further analysis. A variety of charts—around 10 in total—were created to showcase trends in genres, production languages, movie popularity, and more.

The final Tableau dashboard includes:

* Trends in movie genres over time
* Analysis of popular production languages
* Visualization of movie ratings and popularity
* Insights into director success and popularity
A video tutorial was also created to guide users through navigating Tableau and the dashboard effectively.

## Conclusion 
This was a very informative and insightful experience which definitely boosted my confidence and fueled my passion for this field even more. Stayed for the next version where we dive even deeper into developing a recommendation system based on user preferences.
